# React Formik MUI Reusable Component Form

To create a reusable component form with Formik and MUI, you can follow these steps:

Define the form fields: Start by defining the form fields that will be used in the form. This can be done using standard HTML form elements or MUI components.

Create a Formik form: Use the Formik library to create a form with validation and error handling. This will involve defining a schema that describes the shape of the data that will be submitted and creating a Formik component that wraps the form fields.

Add MUI components: Use MUI components to style and lay out the form fields. You can also use MUI components for things like buttons and form helpers.

Make the form component reusable: Finally, create a reusable form component that can be used throughout your application. This can be done by passing in props that define the form fields and validation schema and using them to dynamically generate the form.
